# grunt-init-puppet

Create initial puppet structure for standalone puppet

## Installation
Install grunt-init

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:varokas/grunt-init-puppet.git ~/.grunt-init/puppet
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init puppet
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._

## Installing grunt-init
     sudo apt-get install python-software-properties 
     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js 
     sudo apt-get update 
     sudo apt-get install nodejs
